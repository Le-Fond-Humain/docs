## Setup and usage

### Initial setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect device">
    Plug the encrypted storage device into an available USB port.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install software">
    Download and install the VaultWares management software from the customer portal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize encryption">
    Launch the setup wizard and create your master password or PIN.
    ```bash
    # The device will prompt for initialization
    # Set a strong PIN (8-16 digits)
    # Optionally enroll biometric authentication
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure policies">
    Set password complexity requirements, auto-lock timeout, and other security policies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Daily usage

1. **Unlock the device**: Enter your PIN or use biometric authentication
2. **Access files**: The device appears as a standard removable drive
3. **Lock the device**: Eject the drive or wait for auto-lock timeout

### Enterprise management

Administrators can centrally manage encrypted storage devices:

```bash
# Enroll device in enterprise management
vaultwares-admin enroll --device-id <device-id> --policy enterprise-standard

# Set password policy
vaultwares-admin policy set --min-length 12 --complexity high --max-attempts 5

# Generate compliance report
vaultwares-admin report --type compliance --format pdf
```
