## Overview

VaultWares products undergo rigorous third-party testing and certification to ensure the highest levels of security and compliance. Our certifications demonstrate our commitment to protecting your data and meeting regulatory requirements.

## FIPS 140-2/140-3 certification

### What is FIPS 140?

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 is a U.S. government security standard that specifies requirements for cryptographic modules. FIPS validation is required for federal agencies and widely recognized as the gold standard for cryptographic security.
