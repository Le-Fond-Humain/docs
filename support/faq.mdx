    If the device fails mechanically, data may be recoverable by our data recovery service. If the encryption chip fails, data cannot be recovered. Always maintain backups of critical data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Hardware security modules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between PCIe and network HSMs?">
